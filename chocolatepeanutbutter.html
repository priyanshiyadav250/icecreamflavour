<center><p><h3><font color="Red">There are all kinds of ways to unite chocolate and peanut butter in an ice cream flavor but most typically, you'll find it done as such: dark chocolate ice cream with swirls of peanut butter throughout. Of course, you could always up the PB ante by throwing in some Reese's Peanut Butter Cups as a topping! Chocolate Peanut Butter scores particularly well with Midwesterners.
